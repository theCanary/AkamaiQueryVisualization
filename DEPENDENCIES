Python:

Tornado (Used for the server)
Requests (so far only for fake data creation)
Sortedcontainers (Used for keeping track of alerts and potentially other things, by very fast sorting. Until we have a DB, this is the best I got.)

JS:
Rickshaw (includes D3.js)
jQuery (used for Bootstrap and general event functionality)
Bootstrap (For display)
